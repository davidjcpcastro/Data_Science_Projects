    "# Reinforcement Learning Final Project \n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to your Reinforcement Learning project focused on developing an RL agent capable of playing chess at a strategic level. Chess has long been considered a benchmark for measuring AI capabilities, and this project aims to leverage the power of RL to create an intelligent agent that can make optimal decisions in complex chess positions. By combining the principles of reinforcement learning with the rich strategic domain of chess, you will explore new approaches to create the most effective chess player.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Train an RL agent to play chess: The primary objective of this project is to develop an RL agent that can play chess at a high level of proficiency. The agent should be capable of evaluating chess positions and making strategic decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Optimize decision-making using RL algorithms: Explore different RL algorithms, as seen in class, to train the agent. Compare and analise their effectiveness in learning and decision-making capabilities in the context of chess.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a challenging chess environment: Use a comprehensive environment for the agent to interact with, representing the rules and dynamics of chess. This environment will provide a realistic and challenging setting for the agent's training and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Evaluate and benchmark performance: Assess the performance of the RL agent against different benchmarks from existing chess engines. You will compare your agent's performance to established chess engines to measure progress and identify areas for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extra Objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Investigate transfer learning and generalization: Explore techniques for transfer learning to leverage knowledge acquired in related domains or from pre-training on large chess datasets. Investigate the agent's ability to generalize its knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enhance interpretability and analysis: Develop methods to analise the agent's decision-making process and provide insights into its strategic thinking. Investigate techniques to visualize the agent's evaluation of chess positions and understand its reasoning behind specific moves."

    "## Let's Play Chess! \n",
    "\n",
    "As you know [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess) is a board game for two players, called White and Black, each controlling an army of chess pieces in their color, with the objective to checkmate the opponent's king.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chess is an abstract strategy game that involves no hidden information and no use of dice or cards. It is played on a chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start, each player controls sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. White moves first, followed by Black. Checkmating the opponent's king involves putting the king under immediate attack (in \"check\") whereby there is no way for it to escape.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![](Images/CHESS_MOVES.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The king moves one square in any direction. There is also a special move called castling that involves moving the king and a rook. The king is the most valuable piece — attacks on the king must be immediately countered, and if this is impossible, the game is immediately lost.\n",
    "* A rook can move any number of squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along with the king, a rook is involved during the king's castling move.\n",
    "* A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot leap over other pieces.\n",
    "* A queen combines the power of a rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along a rank, file, or diagonal, but cannot leap over other pieces.\n",
    "* A knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. (Thus the move forms an \"L\"-shape: two squares vertically and one square horizontally, or two squares horizontally and one square vertically.) The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.\n",
    "* A pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file, or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file, provided both squares are unoccupied (black dots in the diagram). A pawn can capture an opponent's piece on a square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square (black crosses). It cannot capture a piece while advancing along the same file. A pawn has two special moves: the en passant capture and promotion."
