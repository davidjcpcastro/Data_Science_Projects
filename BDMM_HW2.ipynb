    "\n",
    "<font size=\"4\">Congratulations! You have been successfully hired as the new Data Engineering and Management team in the AirBNB Business Intelligence department. \n",
    "The organization is undergoing restructuring as the performance of the previous teams was not believed to be satisfactory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before leaving their post, the head of the Data Modelling department left this note of identified issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently a lot of data related to AirBNB listings is all collected in the same document. While this has some advantages it has also caused issues. The query performance is known to be too slow, so some decisions on hybridization of data models are required. The previous team did not have experience in the application of patterns, which has been identified as a key area to improve performance through the enhancement of the data model. Indexes have also not been previously applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The AirBNB application use has been growing rapidly, especially the the number of reviews. Because of that we have been overwriting them regularly, but the business intelligence department will benefit from storing all the Reviews and analysing them over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are some mistakes in the data collection : for instance, writing the same data multiple times, and assigning wrong timestamps for when transactions occurred. The new team will need to decide how to address these.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In your new role, you are expected to think about the database use case in each question, analyse all the information you have, how commonly is this query needed, how heavy will it be on reads and write etc. You should modify the database schema, where you deem appropriate, to optimise for the business use cases. To do so you should use all the tools you have learned in the lab and lectures, especially embedding and linking, indexes, and patterns. This can involve creating new fields, documents, and collections. Indicate which pattern you are applying and your reasoning for doing so in comments, remember to identify any duplication that is required and any risks of staleness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to think about the relevancy of all data that will be returned in each case and if this is needed or adding excessive time to return:\n",
    "1. to streamline the data collection system;\n",
    "2. to clean up the data and optimise what will be returned for each use case;\n",
    "3. to use correct patterns to improve speed of typical queries;\n",
    "4. to ensure that all departments receive correct and relevant information from the database;\n",
    "5. to provide the data model schema to inform other departments of the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good practices in our company include:\n",
    "1. all newly created fields have CAPITALIZED names;\n",
    "2. all new queries function on the most updated version of the database (if you make multiple changes all your queries still work after the final changes);\n",
    "3. for some of the queries you will likely want to change the database schema in some way. Each database transformation choice is properly documented using format:\n",
    "    * `TRANSFORMATION APPLIED: <NAME and DESCRIPTION OF TRANSFORMATION>`\n",
    "    * `REASONING BEHIND: <WHY YOU DID IT>`\n",

    "\n",
    "Before starting on the queries below review the data and look to adjust the schema for the typical use case described below.\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The most typical use case for the database is to show information relating to a property listing to a customer. This is done by a query to the database which returns one of the listing documents. Currently a lot of time is spent when a listing is retrieved from the database to show to a customer. Decide what information should be returned in a typical query and optimise the structure for this use case. For example, we typically only want a sample of reviews but not all reviews (although all reviews ), the customer does not need to know past transaction data, etc. Update the document schema for this typical use case. This may involve the creation of new collections and documents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2) Review the data for any errors (such as transactions that don’t fit the listing) or inappropriate duplication and clean up as appropriate. \n"

    "<font size=\"6\">2. Uses for the database</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=\"4\">Different AirBNB departments require different analytics from our common database.\n",
    "Here are the list of all specific questions from different departments: \n",
    "\n",
    "**Standard Dificulty Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "3)\tOnce per month we like to reward hosts with recognition. Pick three superhosts who have at least two property listings that can accommodate more than four people?\n",
    "\n",
    "4)\tOne of employees is thinking of buying a property to rent out. Which bed type is most common in the listings that have waterfront and a dishwasher in New York?\n",
    "\n",
    "5)\tWe are thinking of identifying someone to hire to write review for us professionally. What is the name of the reviewer who left the longest review in New York?\n",
    "\n",
    "6)\tWe are thinking of trying to assess the security of different areas based on the security deposit required. What is the biggest and smallest difference between the price and deposit for security per number of visitors staying at the property?\n",
    "\n",
    "7)\tWe want to identify areas by whether they are typically used for short breaks, like weekend mini breaks, or whether they are more suitable for long trips. We will use this information to target advertising of different customers. It is not expected this information will change much over time so we won’t look to update it we just would like a current view. What is the average duration of stay (in nights) per type of property per city (you can use the maximum_nights to measure length of stays)? For each property type return the city with the highest and lowest average value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Dificulty Questions (Remember to consider how to optimise the database for these queries):**\n",
    "\n",
    "8)\tWe want to have a new webpage for hosts when setting up their account. It will list suggested typical amenities. This data will need to be available every time a host registers a property but is not expected to change very much. The starting point for the list will be all unique amenities currently listed in properties (across all documents). Optimise the database for this use case and show how the data should be queried.\n",
    "\n",
    "9)\tWe want to start tracking our reviewers better. We want to create a webpage that shows the top 20 reviewers and the count of the number of reviews of each of these reviewers. This webpage should be kept up to date. It should also have a link to return the number of reviews for a given reviewer ID or Name (show how to query for number of reviews by ID or query quickly).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "10)\tFor each property we store review scores across different metrics (accuracy, check-in, cleanliness etc). We are thinking we may soon add more metrics, although we don’t know what these will be. We want to be able to easily query the average score across all of these metrics, including any new metrics that might be added without changing the query. Adjust the data model so this can be done and show the query for an example property.\n",
    "\n",
    "11)\tWe wish to be able to have better access to information about transaction, we wish to develop a search engine that can calculate the average value of transactions in a given period of time quickly for a given property.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "12)\tWe wish to have a summary webpage that displays information about our top destinations. This webpage should display for each of the top 10 cities some basic information about our operations in the area (number of properties by type for example, average price by type) but you can choose the metrics. For each of the top 10 cities it should also provide some basic information about the top 3 properties in each city (price, number of review, whatever you think useful) to show an example of the properties available in the area. We would like to keep this webpage up to date as information changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Database updates:**\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have completed the above tasks and have optimised your database show how you would complete each of the updates below. You can create whatever fictional data you like for the below. Remeber to cosider how to prevent any data you have previously created from becoming stale.\n",
    "\n",
    "13)\tAdd a new property, this property should have a new host, and should be located in one of the top 10 cities. The host selects the top 10 most common amenities to be listed for the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "14)\tAdd a new review to this property, the review should be from one of our top 20 reviewers.\n",
    "\n",
    "15)\tAdd a new review metric called x_factor to the new document and give a score of 10. Show that the average across all metrics is correctly calculated for this listing, with the query you previously developed.\n"

To get the top 20 reviewers in option 1 it would be simple using .find() however to query for a specific reviewer_id or reviewer_name we would need to query the collection 'reviews' which can be much larger and take much longer.

    "Question: We wish to have a summary webpage that displays information about our top destinations. This webpage should display for each of the top 10 cities some basic information about our operations in the area (number of properties by type for example, average price by type) but you can choose the metrics. For each of the top 10 cities it should also provide some basic information about the top 3 properties in each city (price, number of review, whatever you think useful) to show an example of the properties available in the area. We would like to keep this webpage up to date as information changes."

    "    * `TRANSFORMATION APPLIED:First we create a new collection called 'Information_Destinations' where we can find useful information that can helps to extract insights about our top 10 destinations. With the information present in this collection and using an aggregation pipeline we create a new collection called 'Top10_Destinations' where we managed to store all the important and relevant details about our top 10 destinations `\n",
    "    * `REASONING BEHIND: This pipeline applies transformations to the data to prepare it for analysis and then to be used to evaluate the disposition of Airbnb operations as well as some properties regarding each area of influence. Having this kind of information (number of properties by type,average price by type, etc...) in one single collection, enables the Airbnb employees to extract these kind information much more fast, and also give them notion about their operations and how and in what area they need to take determined measures (marketing strategies, reduce price of a booking in a City, increase number of properties etc...). We will talk about some main decisions in this part (all the things related to the code are pointed in the cell below). We consider the top 10 destinations as the places that have more number of properties and more number of transactions. We consider the top 3 properties in each city as the properties with more number reviews (we made this decision beacuse we assumed that if a stay was really nice, the guest will make a review). For each property we provide information about property name, price, number of reviews, accomodates, beds, bedrooms, property type and room type. For each City we provide information about total number of properties and other basic information. `\n",
    "    * `EXPECTED RESULT: separating the top 10 cities data into its own collection and using an aggregation pipeline to query it, we can improve query performance and make it easier to maintain and update the top 10 cities properties list `"

This was firstly updated in the collection 'listings'. Then to compute the average between all review metrics, including the X_FACTOR one, we applied the same query that we used in the question 10, which is a reference to the collection listings, creating then a new document in the collection 'metrics' with all this metrics and its average.`\n",

Restructuring the data model creating a new collection for the review metrics and store a reference to the corresponding listing in each metric document, allow us to address the problem of being able to easily query the average score across all of the review metrics, including this new metric that was added (X_FACTOR). `\n",

As well as the average of all metrics of this new document in another new document of the collection \"metrics\" by using a reference to make it easier to analyze the quality of each property.`"
